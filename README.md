# ARS390final
My artistic goal for this project was to explore the effects of pollution on the environment through the use of machine learning. Nvidia Gaugan interprets and generates each landscape image based on an image database generated by the creator of the program. I wanted to see how the Gaugan would see pollution and trash impacting different parts of the environment.
As I worked more with Nvidia, I got to understand it more. The outputs look especially nice if the filter that is used is colorful and has a lot of contrast, as the input image (landscape image) does not matter much. I also had a better understanding of machine learning and how it is mostly limited to the data that is provided for it. There were some images that did not turn out the way I would have expected (i.e. sunflower), and it could be due to the data that was fed to the program not including close-up photos of sunflowers.
I used nvidia Gaugan for my project and premeire pro. As for the grid, I put all the images in a google doc, converted it to images.
